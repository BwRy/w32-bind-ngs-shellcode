Windows x86 null-free bindshell for Windows 5.0-6.0 all service packs.
Based mainly on code and ideas (C) 2005 by Dafydd Stuttard, NGS Software.
(See http://www.ngssoftware.com/papers/WritingSmallShellcode.pdf).
Thanks to Pete Beck.

Features both in this and the original code:
  + NULL Free
  + Windows version and service pack independant.
Improvements of this code over the original:
  + No assumptions are made about the values of registers.
  + "/3GB" compatible: pointers are not assume to be smaller than 0x80000000.
  + DEP/ASLR compatible: data is not executed, code is not modified.
  + Windows 7 compatible: kernel32 is found based on the length of its name.
  + Stealth: does not display a console windows on the target machine when 
    cmd.exe is executed.
  + Allows an unlimited number of consecutive connections.
  + Can except connections on almost any port. The range of acceptable port
    numbers is only limited by the fact that the negative value of the port
    number must not contain nulls.
